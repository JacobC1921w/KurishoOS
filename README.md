# KurishoOS
Homemade hobby Operating System

Starting out by following a tutorial from Frank Rosner (https://dev.to/frosnerd).

To try it yourself, make sure you have the following packages installed:

```
    git
    nasm
    binutils
    gcc
    qemu-system-x86
    make
```

and test it out using:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JacobC1921w/KurishoOS
    cd KurishoOS
    make clean
    make
```

This will open a qemu window that *hopefully* should boot.

Any suggestion please let me know! This is mainly a hobby thing and I'm trying to do it myself **entirely** - no AI used at all.

The end goal is to make an operating system that is fully function, meaning a graphical manager, login, fully functional shell, filesystem, networking etc.
