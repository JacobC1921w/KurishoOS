# TODO

1. Change variable naming conventions. Not only are they too verbose, however I also want to use snake_case style, and have some proper formatting for things such as constants.
2. Comment some code
3. Split the C header files into .c/.h so it doesn't look like this is the first code I've written ;(
4. Make the Makfile more pretty, and allow for more dynamic compiling, rather than specifying the individual files (i.e. use wildcards)
