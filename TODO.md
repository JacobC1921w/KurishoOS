# TODO

1. Change variable naming conventions. Not only are they too verbose, however I also want to use snake_case style, and have some proper formatting for things such as constants. ✓
2. Comment some code
3. Split the C header files into .c/.h so it doesn't look like this is the first code I've written
4. Make the Makfile more pretty, and allow for more dynamic compiling, rather than specifying the individual files (i.e. use wildcards)
5. Fix keyboard driver unknown key up for: insert, delete, arrows * 4, page(up/down), left control, left alt, windows key being left ctrl+escape(?), and right control/alt not being recognised(+ unknown key up)
6. Make exception messages more dynamic (don't need repeated `Exception: Future reservation` and `Exception: External interrupt (0x--)`)
7. Create a simple working shell
8. Create filesystem stuff
9. Create simple networking driver
10. Make grpahics works
