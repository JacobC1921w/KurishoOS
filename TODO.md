# TODO

1. Change variable naming conventions. Not only are they too verbose, however I also want to use snake_case style, and have some proper formatting for things such as constants. ✓
2. Comment some code ✓
3. Split the C header files into .c/.h so it doesn't look like this is the first code I've written ✓
4. Make the Makfile more pretty, and allow for more dynamic compiling, rather than specifying the individual files (i.e. use wildcards) ✓
5. Allow caps lock (✓) and shift+key functionality (kinda, A-Z keys work, just gotta do everything else)
6. Fix keyboard driver unknown key up for: insert, delete, arrows * 4, page(up/down), left control, left alt, windows key being left ctrl+escape(?), and right control/alt not being recognised(+ unknown key up)
7. Make exception messages more dynamic (don't need repeated `Exception: Future reservation` and `Exception: External interrupt (0x--)`) ✓
8. Create a simple working shell
9. Create filesystem stuff
10. Create simple networking driver
11. Make grpahics works
